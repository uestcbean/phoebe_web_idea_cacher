It only runs when the user explicitly performs the following:

- Uses Chrome's native selectionText API to retrieve the selected text
- Sends the selected text to the user's Notion database via Notion API

## 2. Permission Usage

This extension uses the following permissions:

- `activeTab`: Only accesses the current tab when the user selects text
- `contextMenus`: Provides right-click menu functionality
- `storage`: Stores user configuration
- `host_permissions`: Only accesses Notion API (https://api.notion.com/*)

All permissions follow the principle of least privilege and are used only when necessary.

The extension saves the following information locally in the user's browser:

- Notion integration token provided by the user
- Default Notion database ID set by the user

This information is never transmitted to any external server.

## 5. User Control

Users can:

- Disable or uninstall the extension anytime
